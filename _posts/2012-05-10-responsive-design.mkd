 - _[Responsive Web Design][1]_ by [Ethan Marcotte][2] is a good introduction into this methodology.
 - [@RWD][3] has frequent updates to all things related to responsive web design.
 - [mediaqueri.es][4] is a gallery of responsive sites that illustrate how different approaches to presenting content at varying screen widths.
 - [A Book Apart][5] is an extension of [A List A Part][6] that publishes small books related to the web. I have read several of their books. They are all good.
 - I recommend _[Mobile First][7]_ by [Luke Wroblewski][8]. [His blog][9] is constant source of high-quality information.
 - Luke Wroblewski wrote [an excellent summary][10] of what patterns the sites listed in [mediaqueri.es][4] use.
 - [Brad Frost][11] summarized [common approaches to responsive navigation patterns][12].
 - [Smashing Magazine][13] published [a sample chapter][14] from _[Mobile Design Pattern Gallery][15]_ by [Theresa Neil][16] on patterns for searching, sorting, and filtering in a mobile context
   - The author recommends two additional titles:
     - _[Search Patterns][17]_
     - _[Designing Search; UX Strategies for eCommerce Success][18]_
